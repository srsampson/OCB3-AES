##### Compiling ocb-test.c from command line
To run this quick test by linking the dynamic library, use the following command:

```
c99 -O3 ocb-test.c -o ocb-test -L/home/name/github/OCB3-AES -Wl,-rpath=/home/name/github/OCB3-AES -I../headers -locb
```

Which assumes your github repository is in ```/home/name/github/OCB3-AES``` and ```name``` is your login name.

When testing is complete you can have the administrator move your ```.h``` files to ```/usr/local/include``` and your library to ```/usr/local/lib``` and then they can run ```ldconfig``` so you can add your library to more substantial programs.
